This github page consist of the Machine Learning code that compares the six algorithms (Random Forest, Multilayer Perceptron, Polynomial Regression, Polynomial Regression with Ridge Regularization and K-Nearest Neighbors) that we use to estimate P-wave velocity and bulk density in near-seafloor sediments.
Training data and Validation data for the two Walker Ridge Holes WR313-G and WR313-H can be used from the files in .csv format for Vp Resistivity Case 1, Vp Resistivity Case 2 and Rhob Resistivity Case 1.
Also, there are 3 files that can be used for K-fold cross validation and are named using the suffix _K_fold_CV.
All the files are linked to the code and it can be executed to generate the output predicted Vp and RHOB corresponding to each Case using different algorithms.
